# Bellabeat_Case_Study
This case study was completed in conjunction with completion of the Google Data Analytics Certification. I completed this certificate course at the end of April 2024. Since April, I have been working on an additional certificate course which will be completed shortly. 

Through the course we learned SQL and an introduction to R. This case study uses R to analyse and present the data. I used my business analysis skills to provide recommendations based on the analysis.
